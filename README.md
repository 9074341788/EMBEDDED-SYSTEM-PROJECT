# EMBEDDED PROJECT ON HEAT CONTROLLER 
The main purpose of this Temperature Controller is to control the temperature of any device like AC or any other electronic devices whose temperature keeps fluctuating and thus requires a constant watch on the device. The use of this system eliminates constant watching on the device by self controlling the temperature of the system.

## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1. Draw the  circuit with using mocrocontroller for SIMULATION 
2. Build the embedded C code for different activity 
3. Heat controller circuit by adding all the activity
